**Thai Social Media Depression Detection (NLP & Deep Learning)**
My Role: Data Preprocessing & Baseline Modeling (Team Project)

- Tech Stack: Python, PyThaiNLP, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

- Collaborated to build a text classification pipeline predicting depression indicators from 30,000 Thai social media posts.

- Engineered the text preprocessing pipeline, utilizing PyThaiNLP for accurate tokenization, followed by text-to-sequence conversion and padding to prepare unstructured data for neural networks.

- Developed and evaluated baseline deep learning models (Bi-GRU and Bi-RNN), establishing a solid baseline accuracy of 76%.

- Facilitated the team's subsequent modeling phase; the clean data and baseline metrics directly enabled the successful fine-tuning of a wangchanBERTa model to achieve the final 79% accuracy.
